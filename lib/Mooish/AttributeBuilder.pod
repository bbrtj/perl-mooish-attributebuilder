=head1 NAME

Mooish::AttributeBuilder - build Mooish attribute definitions with less boilerplate

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Moo; # or Moose or Mouse or ...
	use Mooish::AttributeBuilder;

	# this attribute is required in the constructor
	has param 'param_name';
	has param 'param_name' => (
		...
	);

	# this attribute is optional in the constructor
	has option 'option_name';
	has option 'option_name' => (
		...
	);

	# this attribute is not available in the constructor
	has field 'field_name';
	has field 'field_name' => (
		...
	);

	# this extends parent attribute, much like: has '+name_to_extend'
	has extended 'name_to_extend' => (
		...
	);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements shortcuts and helpers for C<has> keyword in Moose family of modules.

The shortcuts provided are similar to those in L<MooseX::Extended> or
L<MooX::Keyword::Field>, but they don't depend on specific OO system. Instead,
those shortcuts are just modifying option lists which are then passed to
C<has>. This way you can use the module with any OO system which supports the
Moose set of C<has> parameters.

=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

All functions are exported by default.

=head2 field

	has field $field_name => %more_options;

This function produces a property that cannot be passed to the constructor:

	has $field_name => (
		is => 'ro',
		init_arg => undef,
		%more_options
	);

=head2 param

	has param $param_name => %more_options;

This function produces a property that is required in the constructor:

	has $param_name => (
		is => 'ro',
		required => 1,
		%more_options
	);

=head2 option

	has option $option_name => %more_options;

This function produces a property that is optional in the constructor and has a predicate:

	has $option_name => (
		is => 'ro',
		required => 0,
		predicate => "has_${option_name}",
		%more_options
	);

=head2 extended

	has extended $name_to_extend => %more_options;

This function does not introduce any extra hash keys, but adds a plus sign before the name:

	has "+${name_to_extend}" => (
		%more_options
	);

=head1 SHORTCUTS

The C<%more_options> hash can contain some shortcuts that will be expanded by
L</option>, L</param>, L</field> or L</extended> functions.

=head2 method name shortcuts

The following values:

	1
	-public
	-hidden

... can be passed to the following options, producing standard method names with given prefixes:

	reader:    get_
	writer:    set_
	predicate: has_
	clearer:   clear_
	builder:   _build_
	trigger:   _trigger_

The naming rules are as follows:

=over

=item

Properties starting with an underscore produce B<hidden> methods when passed C<1> (starting with underscore as well)

	has field '_name' => (
		reader => 1
	);

	# ... becomes:
	has '_name' => (
		...
		reader => '_get_name'
	);

=item

Properties not starting with an underscore produce B<public> methods when passed C<1> (not starting with underscore)

	has field 'name' => (
		writer => 1
	);

	# ... becomes:
	has 'name' => (
		...
		writer => 'set_name'
	);

=item

Visibility can be forced by passing C<-public> or C<-hidden> instead of C<1>

	has field '_name' => (
		predicate => -public
	);

	# ... becomes:
	has '_name' => (
		...
		predicate => 'has_name'
	);


	has field 'name' => (
		predicate => -hidden
	);

	# ... becomes:
	has 'name' => (
		...
		predicate => '_has_name'
	);

=item

C<builder> and C<trigger> are hidden by default. The only way to have them not
start with an underscore (other than passing the name explicitly) is to pass
C<-public>.

These two options also don't change the name based on the leading underscore in
property's name. Builders for C<property> and C<_property> will by default both
be C<_build_property>.

=back

=head2 lazy + default

	lazy => sub { return 'default value' }

... will be expanded to:

	lazy => 1,
	default => sub { return 'default value' }

Note: this only works for anonymous subroutines.
Will not be expanded if explicit default / builder was passed (but does not take superclass default / builder into account).

=head2 lazy + builder

	lazy => 'builder_name'

... will be expanded to:

	lazy => 1,
	builder => 'builder_name'

Note: passing C<1> will work as described in L</method name shortcuts>.
Will not be expanded if explicit default / builder was passed (but does not take superclass default / builder into account).

=head2 isa + coerce

	coerce => Types::Standard::Int

... will be expanded to:

	isa => Types::Standard::Int,
	coerce => 1

As long as it is a blessed reference (object).

=head2 builder / default + required

Having a C<builder> or a C<default> will automatically remove C<required> from the option list.

	# will no longer be required in the constructor
	has param 'optional' => (
		default => undef,
	);

=head2 init_arg

C<init_arg> can use the same shortcuts as described in L</method name shortcuts>.

This can be useful to turn C<_name> into C<name> in the constructor with the help of C<-public>:

	# no underscore in the constructor
	has param '_name' => (
		init_arg => -public,
	);

=head2 trigger

In addition to shortcuts described in L</method name shortcuts>, C<trigger> can
now be passed both as a anon sub (like C<default>) or as a package sub name
(like C<builder>).

=head2 use parameter value without expanding

In case you want to fall back to default behavior of some C<has> parameters,
you can prepend their names with a hyphen:

	# 'builder' will be expanded, but 'writer' won't
	has field 'auto' => (
		builder => 1,
		-writer => 1,
	);

=head1 CUSTOM SHORTCUTS

It is possible to introduce custom shortcuts by calling C<add_shortcut>:

	use Mooish::AttributeBuilder;
	use Data::Dumper;

	Mooish::AttributeBuilder::add_shortcut(sub {
		my ($name, %args) = @_;

		print Dumper(\%args);

		return %args;
	});

Each new option filter must be an anonymous subroutine that accepts
C<($name, %args)> and returns new value for C<%args>. C<$name> will contain
full name of the attribute (which can be an array reference), while C<%args>
are attribute options plus a C<"_type"> key, which is the name of the helper,
e.g. C<"param">.

Custom shortcuts are called before built in shortcuts described in
L</SHORTCUTS>, in order of declaration. Make sure not to call C<add_shortcut>
repeatedly with the same sub, as the module will not run any checks to prevent
duplication.

Example, making fields C<rw> by default:

	Mooish::AttributeBuilder::add_shortcut(sub {
		my ($name, %args) = @_;

		if ($args{_type} eq 'field') {
			$args{is} = 'rw';
		}

		return %args;
	});

=head2 For module authors

If you want to use Mooish::AttributeBuilder in your module, these custom
filters are undesirable. You want to be sure your module works regardless of
environment. In CPAN modules the module should be imported with the C<-standard>
flag, which will disable all custom behavior.

	use Mooish::AttributeBuilder -standard;

This flag was added in Mooish::AttributeBuilder version C<1.001>.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over

=item Partial support for multiple attributes per 'has'

The module lets you write for example:

	has field ['f1', 'f2'] => %params;
	has extended ['f3', 'f4'] => %params;

These constructions work, but since we operate on a single C<has> here,
C<%params> can't contain shortcuts which produces method names - that would
lead to multiple fields using same methods. The module will die with a helpful
error message if it encounters something that it can't handle properly.

If you encounter this problem, you might want to
L</use parameter value without expanding> to fall back to regular shortcut modules
(like L<MooseX::AttributeShortcuts>). This module will not automatically change its
behavior to do so, so it does not surprise you.

=item All attributes produced are 'ro' by default

Since the module does not depend on specific OO implementation, the only common
C<< is => >> options are C<ro> and C<rw> (as in base Moose). The author considers
C<rw> to be a I<bad idea> most of the time. Having one method for reading and
writing can lead to bugs that are hard to spot.

Other than that:

C<< writer => -hidden >> shortcut does more or less what C<rwp> does.

C<< lazy => 1 >> shortcut does more or less what C<lazy> does.

=item Partial MooseX::AttributeShortcuts compatibility

The module implements many of the shortcuts from L<MooseX::AttributeShortcuts>,
but does not aim to have 100% compatibility. Some details in overlapping
functionality may differ.
